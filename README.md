# QuackView

This is a project I started to replace my Dakboard dashboard display. It was intended to be more of a quick and dirty solution. We'll see where it goes. It's really intended just for myself to play around. Perhaps it'll become useful to someone...

I'm still debating the name. I might change it to one of these:

- QuackDash
- QuackBoard
- ???
