# Jobs

## Quack Job

This is the command line tool that provides most of the "standard" out of the box jobs needed to collect the data for the display.

WARNING: I built this because I wanted to play with C# since I haven't written anything in .Net since .Net Framework 4.5. Don't expect a masterpiece if you dig around in the code. I'm re-leaning a lot. This is proof of concept at best...

### Usage

WARNING: I'm going to be changing all of the command line flags in the near future now that I have a better idea of what I want to do. I'll shift to focus around job files rather than long command line arguments.

#### Help

`quackjob help`

This is changing too fast to keep this file updated, see help for most current usage.

#### Run a job

`quackjob run --job=<job-file`

TODO:
Change this to:
`quackjob run <job-file`
